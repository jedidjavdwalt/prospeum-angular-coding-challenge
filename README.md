To run prospeum-angular-coding-challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Use the command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the app using the `cd` command. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project/directory
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the command:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - This will download and install all the necessary packages listed in your `package.json` file.

4. **Serve the App:**
   - After installing dependencies, you can now serve the app locally. Use the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to serve the app. Run:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - This command will compile your Angular app and start a development server. By default, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser.

5. **Access the App:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` (or the specific URL shown in your terminal after running `ng serve`).
   - The app should now be running, and you can interact with it through the UI.

Make sure to replace `<repository-url>` and `path/to/your/project/directory` with actual values specific to your project's setup.
